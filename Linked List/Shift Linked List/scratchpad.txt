Shift a linked list by K positions
K > 0 => shift forward
K < 0 => shift backward

1 -> 2 -> 3
shift by K = 1
=> 3 -> 1 -> 2

1. Break at the partition point i.e. new head
2. Connect the tail with original head
3. Replace the head with new head

n = 5

i = 0 -> n - k = 5 - 2 = 3

0    1   2

1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
k = 2

4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
